# ZKP Authentication Protocol

This repository contains the implementation of a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) authentication protocol, aimed at replacing traditional password hashing methods. This protocol is based on the [Chaum-Pedersen Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_Verifiable_Secret_Sharing#Chaum-Pedersen_Protocol), adapted for 1-factor authentication, ensuring the security of user authentication processes, described in "[Cryptography: An Introduction (3rd Edition) by Nigel Smart](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~waa/414-F11/IntroToCrypto.pdf)".
